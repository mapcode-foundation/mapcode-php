# Mapcode Library for PHP

Copyright (C) 2014-2022 Stichting Mapcode Foundation (http://www.mapcode.com)

----

This PHP project contains a library to encode latitude/longitude pairs to mapcodes
and to decode mapcodes back to latitude/longitude pairs.

## Example

This is an example of how to use this library as of version 2.3.0 via composer.

### Installing via Composer

```bash
$ composer require mapcodes/mapcodes
```

### Usage

```php

use Mapcode\Coord;

use function Mapcode\encodeInternational as mapcodeEncodeInternational;
use function Mapcode\decode as mapcodeDecode;

$arrayWithResult = mapcodeEncodeInternational(42.5077402, -83.1954047); // T8BBD.YLN0

$decoded = mapcodeDecode("T8BBD.YLN0"); // Returns `Mapcode\Coord` on successful decode

if($decoded instanceof Coord)
{
    echo "{$decoded->lat}, {$decoded->lon}\n";
}

```

## Version History

### 2.3.0

* Updated to move everything into the `Mapcode` namespace, remove dependencies on global variables
* Added support for composer via composer.json

### 2.2.3

* Updated to support PHP version 8.1.4 (thanks, Bert Hooyman).

### 2.2.2

* Fixed PHP errors for new version of PHP.

* Cleaned up/reformatted source code.

### 2.2.0 - 2.2.1

* Solved 1-microdegree gap in a few spots on Earth, noticable now extreme precision is possible.

### 2.1.5

* Reworked high-precision to pure integer math.

* Enforce encode(decode(m))=m except at territory borders.
* Added maxErrorinMeters to API.

### 2.1.1

* Added DistanceInMeters to API.

### 2.1.0

* Rewrote fraction floating points to integer arithmetic.

* Several fixes; extended unit tests.

### 2.0.3

* Added unittest.php, which verifies that the library works as expected.

### 2.0.2

* Ported fast_encode from C library (4x faster global encoding).

* Minor improvements (stricter tests).

### 2.0.0

* Initial open source release. (The release starts at 2.0.0 because the
mapcode algorithms match the 2.0.x releases in Java, C/C++, and other
languages.)
